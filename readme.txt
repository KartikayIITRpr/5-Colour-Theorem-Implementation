Instruction to run the program:
Please find project.c file in the file. Input graph should be planar and the the input edges can be inputed in any way i.e, i j or (i,j), etc. to exit the inserting mode Q should be inputted. 

Summary:
The program shows that any planar undirected graph can be coloured with 5 colours. We have implemented the program using 5 color theorem and backtrack. The time complexity of the program is of the order O(n). The 5 color theorem is useful in coloring the maps so that not to regions with same boundary have different colours.
